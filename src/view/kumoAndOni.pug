			| My Roles
		p 
			| I was in charge of programming the gameâ€™s finite state machine which serialized the levels and narratives, as well as the interactive user interface such as the UI buttons, health UI, and interaction pop-ups. I have also collaborated with one of my teammates to design and implement the level maps and puzzle mechanics.
